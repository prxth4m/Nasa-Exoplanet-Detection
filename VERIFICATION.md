## ❌ What Can Be Deleted (After Testing)

### These folders are NO LONGER NEEDED:

1. **`cosmic-classifier-web/`**
   - ❌ Old frontend folder
   - ❌ Contains duplicate of what's now in `organized-project/frontend/`
   - ❌ Has extra duplicate folder inside it
   - Safe to delete ✅

2. **`EXOPLANETS/`**
   - ❌ Training scripts (modelcnn.py, project_main.py)
   - ❌ Not needed for running the app
   - ❌ Only needed if you want to retrain models
   - Safe to delete ✅

3. **`EXOPLANETS 1/planopticon-bcknd/`**
   - ❌ Old backend folder
   - ❌ Contains duplicate of what's now in `organized-project/backend/`
   - ❌ Has __pycache__ and other cache files
   - Safe to delete ✅

4. **`.venv/`** (in root NasaSpace folder)
   - ❌ Old virtual environment
   - ❌ Will create new one in `organized-project/backend/venv/`
   - Safe to delete ✅

---

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT - Test First!

**DO NOT delete old folders until you verify organized-project works:**

### Step 1: Test the New Structure
```powershell
cd c:\Users\prath\OneDrive\Documents\NasaSpace\organized-project
.\setup.ps1
```

### Step 2: Start Backend
```powershell
cd backend
.\venv\Scripts\activate
python app.py
```

**Expected output:**
```
✓ RandomForest model loaded successfully
✓ Scaler loaded successfully
✓ CNN model loaded successfully
* Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000
```

### Step 3: Start Frontend (New Terminal)
```powershell
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

**Expected output:**
```
VITE v5.4.19  ready in XXX ms
➜  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
```

### Step 4: Test All Features
- [ ] Open http://localhost:5173
- [ ] Data Explorer loads with CSV data
- [ ] Lightcurve classifier works
- [ ] AI Classifier works
- [ ] All 3 features function properly

---

## ✅ If Everything Works - Safe to Delete

**Only after successful testing above:**

```powershell
# Navigate to NasaSpace folder
cd c:\Users\prath\OneDrive\Documents\NasaSpace

# Delete old folders ONE BY ONE (be careful!)
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force "cosmic-classifier-web"
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force "EXOPLANETS"
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force "EXOPLANETS 1"
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force ".venv"

# Verify only organized-project remains
Get-ChildItem
```

**Final structure should be:**
```
NasaSpace/
└── organized-project/
    ├── backend/
    ├── frontend/
    └── documentation files
```

**Optional - Rename to final name:**
```powershell
Rename-Item "organized-project" "planopticon"
```
